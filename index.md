Hi, I’m a Marketing Executive focused on SEO-first content that gets discovered

I’ve been working in SaaS marketing for the past 6 months, primarily across content writing, SEO, community-led distribution, and product documentation.

Before this role, I had never written or published a blog.
I learned by shipping — and by measuring what actually shows up on Google, not just what reads well internally.

This page serves as my public content writing portfolio, covering:

SEO blogs (educational + comparison)

Product-led tutorials

Bottom-of-funnel content

Help desk & documentation revamp

Help Desk & Product Documentation

Beyond blogs, I’ve also worked on help desk revamping and product documentation.

AppLaunchpad Help Desk

Modor Help Desk

My contribution focused on:

Rewriting unclear or fragmented articles

Simplifying product workflows into step-by-step guidance

Improving structure, hierarchy, and readability

Making documentation usable for non-designers and first-time users

This work was aimed at reducing onboarding friction and improving self-serve support.

How I Think About Content

I don’t write content to “fill a blog.”

I write to:

Match real search intent

Solve one clear problem per page

Structure content so both humans and search engines understand it

Treat content as a long-term growth asset, not a publishing task

If a piece ranks, gets reused, or gets cited by systems like Google AI Overview, I treat that as validation.

What I’m Looking For

I’m interested in roles where:

Content is treated as a growth lever

Early ownership is encouraged

Judgment matters more than checklists

SEO, product, and user understanding intersect

Early-stage SaaS, developer tools, and product-led teams are a natural fit for how I work.

Closing

I’m still early in my career, but I care deeply about doing work that holds up outside internal dashboards — in search results, communities, and real usage.

If this resonates, I’d be happy to talk.
